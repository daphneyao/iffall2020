        <li><p>I'm Daphne. I'm a senior majoring in Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology. I also have minors in math and design.</p></li>
        <li><p>I've taken some design classes at WashU before, but I've always wanted to learn more specifically about web design so I decided to take this course.</p></li>
        <li><p>I've played with HTML/CSS on my own a little bit and have watched some online videos on coding in HTML/CSS, but haven't been able to get past the basics. I also took an intro CS course at WashU and did some programming back in high school, so I have some background coding in other languages (e.g. Java).</p></li>
        <li><p>I hope to learn more about CSS as well as JavaScript so I can make websites that are more pleasing to look at + more dynamic.</p></li>
        <li><p>I think designing for screen would require more thought on how users would interact with elements of the design compared to designing for paper.</p></li>
        <li><p>I think <a href=“https://noccoffeeco.com/en/“>this coffee shop</a>’s website showcases effective design. The site is very pleasing to view and the design nicely communicates the structure of the website and the story of the brand. The landing page provides communication and navigation to all other pages without the need of scrolling. If one hovered over links to other pages, related videos appear, along with descriptions of the page you would be navigated to.</p></li>
        <li><p>I think <a href="https://www.glossier.com/">Glossier</a>'s site exemplifies effective communication because it tells a continuous product story very well within one page. Not only is the color scheme consistent, the brand motto is also integrated - “skin first, makeup second.” The page is also organized well, with the most popular products on top and then breaking down into products in different categories.</p></li>
        <li><p>I think <a href=“https://www.everlane.com/“>Everlane</a>’s website works well. Although the site has a simple design, it works well because of the use of consistent colors and a variety of fonts that fit well together. The site is also easy to navigate in, with the main categories staying at the top of the page. Along with displaying products, the brand also showcases its promises to sustainability on the landing page, highlighting its difference from other clothing brands.</p></li>
